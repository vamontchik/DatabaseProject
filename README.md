# cs411project
A database project featuring docker containers to construct a front-end and a back-end. A node container with react was used for the front end. A python container with flask was used as a gateway between node and the databases, communicating via HTTP endpoints with JSON. There are two database containers that constitute the back-end: one for mongoDB, and one for mySQL.
